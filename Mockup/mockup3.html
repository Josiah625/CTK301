				<h2> About Me </h2>
				<p> 

					I'm a passionate audio music producer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist with a strong foundation in guitar, vocals, and worship leadership. With years of hands-on experience in both live and studio settings, I specialize in writing, recording, mixing, and mastering music that resonates.
					
					I’ve released five full-length albums with my band, Cats and Dragons, blending creativity with technical precision to bring our sound to life. I also have a heart for worship ministry and have led worship in various church settings, including an internship at First United Methodist Church, where I gained valuable experience in both live sound and spiritual leadership.
					
					Whether I’m producing in the studio or leading a congregation in song, my goal is always to create music that connects and inspires.
